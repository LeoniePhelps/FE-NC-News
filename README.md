# Northcoders News Project

## About

Northcoders News is a web application made with React JS. It is designed to be the front-end of a news app with similar functionality to Reddit.com. The web application uses my Northcoders News API (https://github.com/LeoniePhelps/BE-NC-News).

The home page presents users with a list of articles which can be filtered by topic using buttons and sorted using drop-down menus. Clicking on an article brings the user to the page for the specific article, where the full article can be read. Users can also like or dislike an article, view and add a comment, and delete their own comments.

The web application uses:

- React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useContext
- React Router
- API data fetching with Axios
- Responsive mobile first design using CSS
- Form validation
- Optimistic and conditional rendering

## Hosted Version
